D3DQuakeX v1.3
========================
This is a port of GLQuake to the original XBox using FakeGL as the XBox has no support for OpenGL.

Version history:

v1.0
- Initial release.

v1.1
- New SDL sound driver.
- Background music working using new sound driver.
- XBox controller buttons black and white can now be bound.

v1.2
- Fixed lookspring been forced on.
- Fixed some 2D quads not rendering correctly sometimes.

v1.3
- Fixed support for SD TVs, now works on anything.

Known bugs (WIP):

1.) Sometimes auto fire randomly turns on.

3.) Pressing up in the options menu from the first item will highlight an invisible menu item
underneath the last menu item.

4.) Look inversion option doesn't work.

6.) Controls not sticking.

Note: SDLx is required to build (used for sound).
